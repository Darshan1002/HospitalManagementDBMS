# HospitalManagementDBMS
 A DBMS mini-project using python GUI.
 Use 'DB Browser for Sqlite' software for opening the .db file
 Run main.py

Sequencing doesn't work properly when "all entries" are deleted from the database ie. there should be a minimum of one entry in the db for sequencing to work. If sequencing fails change the its value in .db file. Other than that everything works.
